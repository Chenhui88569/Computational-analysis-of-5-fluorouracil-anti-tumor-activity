# Computational-analysis-of-5-fluorouracil-anti-tumor-activity
The entire model is composed of PK, cellular, and tumor growth inhibition (TGI) sub-models (shown in figures below), the last two of which constitute the PD model. The PK model is used to compute the concentration-time profile, and the TGI model focuses on the kinetics of tumor growth post-treatment.

## Resistance analysis
The resistance analysis is discussed in detail in the manucript. The main functions in the folder are for resistance analysis are @Resistance_main_oncluster.m and Resistance_main_plot.m, which run on the cluster using Matlab Parallel computing to save extensive computational time. @Resistance_main_oncluster.m is served to execute the seven scenarios. For each scenario, based on the sampled N parameter sets, the N time courses of tumor volume, anabolites and DSBs are computed and stored, which are futhered processed and dispalyed in Fig 5, which is generated by function @Resistance_main_plot.m. The rest of the functions in the folder are called by the two main functions. Their associated roles are indicated by their function names.
  
## Parameter estimation-Gadient based optimization
Functions for estimating parameters for each submodel are included. The main functions are kinetics_dNTP_main.m kinetics_DSB_main.m kinetics_PKand3to10_main.m kinetics_TumorVolume_main.m. We conducted the sequential parameter estimation because it is computationally infeasible to estimate all the parameters once and all.
## parameter estimation-MCMC
We utilized the Bayesian inference method to estimate the expected values of the model parameters as the Bayesian inference can capture the uncertainty of model parameters given the experimental data. Specifically, the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique is applied to obtain the approximated expected values. 

## Plot Fig 2,3,4
We used Matlab to plot the time courses of variables defined in the PK, celluar and TGI model, which are performed 
Functions for plotting the figures in which  are put in the paper. The scripts are @PlotAllIntermediates.m, @PlotAllTGIModels.m, and @PlotMutIDose_DSB_Ana.m

## Model generalizability, Sensitivity Analysis, and AUC calculation
The main function is @DoseDifference main.m used to carry out the three tasks.
## TimeCourses_DSB_Anabolites
The folder includes the precomputed time courses of DSB and 5-FU anabolites using predefined cellular model for each of nine TGI models to speed up the process of estimating parameters in TGI models.
